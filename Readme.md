Technologies Used 
The following technologies were used in the development of this machine learning application:
-	Python: The programming language used to build the application.

-	TensorFlow: An open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks, including machine learning and deep learning.

-	Numpy: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

-	Matplotlib: A plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.

-	Scikit-learn: A machine learning library for the Python programming language that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.

-	Flask: A web framework for Python that is used for building web applications.

-	Pillow: A library for the Python programming language that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different images file formats.

-	BeautifulSoup: A library for the Python programming language that is used for web scraping purposes.

-	Requests: A library for the Python programming language that is used for making HTTP requests in Python.

-	os: A module in the Python standard library that provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality.

-	datetime: A module in the Python standard library that supplies classes for working with dates and times.

-	HTML/CSS: Used for building the front-end of the web application.

Additionally, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture was used for building the machine learning model for this application. The model was trained on a dataset of 4,242 images of flowers from around the world. The dataset contains images of 5 different species of flowers. Finally, the model achieved an accuracy of 97% on the test set.
