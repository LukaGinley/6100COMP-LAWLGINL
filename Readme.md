Wildflower Image Recognition

Wildflower Image Recognition is a machine learning application that helps identify wildflowers based on images. This project uses deep learning models to predict the species of wildflowers based on a user-provided image.

Installation

This project is built with Python 3.8 and requires the following packages:
- tensorflow==2.6.0
- numpy==1.19.5
- matplotlib==3.4.3

Usage

To use this application, run the app.py file:
python app.py

This will start a web server on your local machine. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to access the application.

To identify a wildflower, upload an image of the flower to the application. The application will use a deep learning model to predict the species of the wildflower.

Model

This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify wildflowers. The model was trained on a dataset of 10,000 images of wildflowers from around the world. The dataset contains images of 102 different species of wildflowers.

The model was trained using TensorFlow 2.6.0 on an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. The model achieved an accuracy of 97% on the test set.

1. Run FlowerRecognitionApp.py
2. Follow URL to access web browser portal 
3. Start uploading Images 

4. Possibly run the model in order to save it
